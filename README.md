# Arduino OBD2 reader

This Arduino snippet reads OBD2 PIDs data using a [Freematics OBD-II UART Adapter V2.1 (for Arduino)](https://freematics.com/products/freematics-obd-ii-uart-adapter-mk2/).
The data is displayed in realtime through a Nokia 5110 display and the parameters can be selected through a rotary encoder.
The PCB board also features 3 RGB LEDs that are utilized as speed limit indicators.
